## Autonomous Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Check out a concept video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XroYwUxzD4) to learn more about AMRI. To request AMRI to be used as online service, fill out this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/1FpGeH7S9SJbaBP53). Read more [here](#demos).

### Why autonomous?
Globally, there are **4.6 MRI scanners per 1,000,000** people. In comparison, there are 36.72 per 1,000,000 in the United States [[1]](#references)[[2]](#references), and the **low-income countries have 0.1 per 1,000,000**. Annual Healthcare spending in the US is 700 billion USD. Of this **125 – 200 billion USD** (at least) is accounted for by diagnostic imaging [[3]](#references). Autonomous scanners can play a major role in tackling the challenges of delivering MR to a larger population with low-incomes. [[4]](#references).

### And what is MR Value?
MR value can be defined to the patient as the ratio of actionable diagnostic information to the costs or time incurred. A simplified and technically relevant definition of MR value is: ratio of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) to the total scanner (table) time.

### MRI scanner as an Intelligent Physical System (IPS)
AMRI is capable of transforming a conventional MR system into an IPS that can be characterised by the following capabilities:
- Cognizant
- Taskable
- Adaptive
- Ethical
- Reflective (Reuse, Retain, Revise)

The above capabilities would deliver an IPS that is knowledge-rich, and capable of long-term autonomy with minimal human intervention and supervision.

### Utilization of file standards
AMRI can be easily built, rebuilt and deployed as it leverages 4 existing file standards and introduces 1 new file standard. These file standards are:
- EMR file standard for subject information encryption
- Situation report (Sitrep) file standard for sampling MR system state (introduced in this work)
- Pulseq [[5, 6]](#references) file standard for multi-vendor pulse sequence programming
- ISMRMRD file standard for acquired raw data
- DICOM file standard for reconstructed image data

### Demos
An example of some of these file standards as part of brain screen protocol [[7]](#references) experiments can be found [here](https://github.com/imr-framework/imr-framework/tree/master/amri). YouTube demos can be found here:
- Invivo experiment, [link](https://youtu.be/ccKxyWZLjto)
- Phantom experiment, [link](https://youtu.be/ZToRLwXQW1A)

#### AMRI - Scanner as an Online Service (AMRI-SOS)
AMRI-SOS enables students and researchers with limited access to MRI hardware to leverage AMRI to run custom pulse sequences designed on the Pulseq[[5, 6]](#references) framework. If you want to run your scans on a Siemens Prisma 3T, fill out this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/1FpGeH7S9SJbaBP53).
